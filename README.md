# Transforming Agriculture with Data Science and Remote Sensing: Modeling Agricultural Activity Status and Generating Agricultural Statistics

## Introduction

Agriculture stands as a cornerstone of both economy and society, providing sustenance and raw materials for industries. However, generating precise and up-to-date agricultural statistics poses a challenge due to the necessity of regular field data collection, which proves costly in terms of time and resources. 

To tackle this issue, we present a project in data science and remote sensing that employs satellite imagery to analyze agricultural activity status and automate the generation of agricultural statistics. This approach enables accurate and timely information retrieval without the constant need for field data collection, leading to significant cost reduction.

## Problem Description

Traditionally, field data collection has served as the primary source for agricultural statistics. However, this approach presents several challenges, including:

- High costs: Field data collection entails personnel, transportation, and time expenses, particularly in remote or extensive areas.
- Time and effort: The process of gathering and analyzing field data is laborious and time-consuming, hindering frequent data updates.
- Errors and biases: Manual data collection is prone to human errors and biases, potentially affecting the quality and accuracy of agricultural statistics.
- Temporal and seasonal changes: Crop dynamics vary over time due to seasonal and climatic factors, necessitating constant monitoring for data currency.

In this context, our project aims to address these challenges by leveraging satellite imagery and data science techniques to automatically analyze and classify agricultural areas and generate relevant statistics.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to model agricultural activity status and automate the generation of agricultural statistics.

## Research Questions

1. Is it feasible to accurately identify and differentiate areas prepared for planting from those already planted using satellite imagery and machine learning techniques?
2. What is the level of precision and reliability of the developed classification models compared to traditional field data collection methods?
3. How does the accuracy and precision of classification models vary based on the characteristics of satellite imagery, such as spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution?
4. What is the impact of employing different machine learning algorithms and feature extraction approaches on the accuracy and efficiency of classification?
5. Can the proposed approach be adapted and scaled to different geographical regions and crop types, and how does its performance vary across different contexts?
6. How do seasonal and climatic factors influence the accuracy of classification and the generation of agricultural statistics using satellite imagery?

## Data Acquisition and Dataset Generation

Monthly satellite images were collected from an agricultural area of interest. To process these images, values of different spectral bands such as red, green, and near-infrared were extracted. Vegetation indices such as NDVI and NDMI were generated from these bands using standard formulas in the field of remote sensing. Training was conducted to identify planted areas, areas prepared for planting, and non-agricultural plots based on photointerpretation.
